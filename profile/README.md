## Welcome to the ANU BDSI github organisation ðŸ‘‹

BDSI is an interdisciplinary academic unit in the College of Science that sits at the interface of data science and biological science. 
It aims to recruit, build and coordinate expertise in the expanding field of biological data science to accelerate the translation of data to domain knowledge. 
Operating in the space between traditional disciplines, the BDSI is positioned to collaborate across the ANU campus and with partner organisations to solve problems that have impact.
